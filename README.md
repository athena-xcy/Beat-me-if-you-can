# Beat-me-if-you-can
Beat me if you can! is an interactive Tic Tac Toe game. But it's not easy to win over the computer. Try it yourself!

## Inspiration

I am a CS beginner. I just started intro to CS course **2 months** before. Yet, here I am, not experienced, but ready to take up challenges. I just learned arrays in class this week. Therefore, I decided to build something difficult but within my knowledge so far. 

## What it does
Beat me if you can! is an interactive Tic Tac Toe game. But it's not easy to win over the computer. 

## How I built it
At first, I had no idea what the general structure should look like. Therefore, I started to build the simple parts of it and tried different angles to crack the problems. Later, I thought about what human beings' thinking process was and simulated the whole process by coding. And it worked out nicely! With this experience, I also started to understand how Artificial Intelligence works: scientists observe and conclude how human beings think and then simulate the similar thinking process by using language that machines can understand and work on. 

## Challenges I ran into
At first, I didn't know where to start. I was daunted by seemingly myriad possibilities and had no idea how my program was going to look like. But I am so glad that I kept thinking about it and cracked the problem step by step. When I almost finished it, I didn't even realize that every functionality I previously thought of worked out nicely! 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
As a programming beginner, I got out of my comfort zone and came to a hackathon to get exposed to the experience and build something cool I am most capable of so far. I encountered lots of problems, but I didn't give up and keep trying. I so proud to say that I solved this problem independently. It's the longest program I have ever written so far. I take my pride in my perseverance and courage.

## What I learned
I used to think, to be a good programmer, you really had to be super intelligent. Yet, today I realize that perseverance and patience are far more important than intelligence. High intelligence can make you a faster learner, but only persistence will take you far.

## What's next for Beat me if you can!
I want to make it unbeatable. There is still ways for users to win over my program. I want to consider all the possibilities and make my strategy perfect.
